This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS specificity issue.  The problem lies in understanding how CSS specificity works when multiple selectors target the same element. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous CSS, and `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version. The unexpected behavior is explained in the comments within the code. The solution involves adjusting the CSS to fix the specificity conflict, ensuring the intended styles are applied correctly.
